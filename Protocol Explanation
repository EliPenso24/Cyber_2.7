My protocol establishes a JSON-based control plane for file operations,
ensuring reliable communication through a consistent message structure.
Every message, whether a request from the client or a response from the server,
is a self-contained JSON string delimited by the <END> marker.
Client requests use the command key to specify the desired action (e.g., DIR, DELETE),
passing any necessary inputs within the params dictionary.
This params dictionary supports zero, one, or two arguments.
For example, the zero-parameter command EXIT requires only the command name;
the one-parameter command DIR requires a path; and the two-parameter command
COPY requires both source and destination paths.
The server's response follows a similar JSON structure, using the status key
("success" or "error")and a message.
Crucially, operations involving files, such as SEND_PHOTO, use the JSON response
to send metadata (like the file size),
and then immediately follow up by transmitting the raw binary data over the same socket connection,
separating control information from the bulk data transfer.
