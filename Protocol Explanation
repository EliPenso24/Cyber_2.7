The Protocol serves as the system's communication standard,
acting as both a translator and packager for actions and responses over the TCP network connection.
For client actions, the Protocol consistently packages the command (e.g., DIR, DELETE, COPY) along
with any necessary variables (zero to two, such as file paths) into a structured JSON Request.
Upon execution by the server's function handler, the server uses the Protocol to format the result
into a JSON Response, which includes a status (success or error), a descriptive message, and any resulting data.
Crucially, when a client requests a file using the SEND_PHOTO command, the server first sends a JSON Response
containing the requested file's exact size in bytes (N), and only then uses the Protocol to perform a separate,
dedicated transfer of the raw binary data (the file itself) to ensure efficient file transmission.
